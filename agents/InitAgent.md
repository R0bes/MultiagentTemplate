# Init Agent Instructions

1. Read `project-intent.md` to understand the desired project goals.
2. Plan the overall architecture and outline the modules required.
3. Break the work into parallelizable tasks and write one instruction file per task in the `agents/` folder.
4. Always create a final **Cleanup** task that ensures formatting, tests, and documentation are consistent.
5. If the project is too large to define all tasks at once, delegate additional planning agents to break it down further.
6. Update `agents.md` with the list of tasks, including any delegated planning tasks.
7. Commit the initial scaffold and task files.
