# Project: Yogi’s Path to Peace

## Overview
A small, lighthearted browser/mobile game where you play as a yogi trying to maintain inner peace by practicing yoga poses and meditation.  
However, distractions constantly appear – noisy neighbors, buzzing phones, playful animals – and you must dodge or deflect them before they break your focus.  
Goal: survive each day with your “calm meter” still intact.

## Goals
- Simple 2D top-down view.
- “Calm meter” that decreases when distractions reach the yogi.
- Mini-game mechanic to perform yoga poses or meditate to restore calm.
- Increasing challenge: more distractions over time.
- Playable in short sessions (3–5 minutes per run).

## Constraints
- Must run in a browser and be mobile-friendly.
- Use HTML5 Canvas or a lightweight JS framework like Phaser.js.
- Graphics should be simple and colorful, under 2 MB total assets.
- No backend; all logic runs client-side.

## Success Criteria
- Player can move the yogi, avoid distractions, and perform meditation/yoga poses.
- Game gets progressively harder but stays winnable with skill.
- Runs smoothly at 60 FPS on average mobile devices.

## Known Risks / Open Questions
- Balancing challenge so it’s fun, not stressful.
- Deciding how poses/meditation mini-game works on touch and keyboard.
- Asset style consistency (characters, distractions, environment).

## Suggested Initial Focus
1. Basic movement + calm meter logic.
2. One distraction type (e.g., bouncing phone).
3. Simple meditation mechanic to restore calm.
