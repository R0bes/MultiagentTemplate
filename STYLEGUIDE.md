# Coding Style Guide

- Target **Python 3.11+**.
- Use descriptive naming: `snake_case` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for classes.
- Organize code under `src/` by module.
- Type hints are required for all public functions and methods.
- Document modules and functions with concise docstrings.
- Keep functions small and focused; prefer composition over inheritance.
