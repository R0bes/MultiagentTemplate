# Contributing Guidelines

- Each agent follows the instructions in its dedicated file under `agents/`.
- Contributions should stay within the assigned module or folder.
- All code must be testable; place tests in `tests/`.
- Commit small, focused changes with clear messages.
- Ensure existing tests pass before committing.
